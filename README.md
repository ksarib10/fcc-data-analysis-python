# Data Analysis with Python Projects

This repository contains my solutions to the **FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python** certification projects.  
Each folder represents a project with its implementation and tests.

## üìÇ Projects
### 1. **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator**
   - File: `mean_var_std.py`
   - Tests: `test_module.py`
   - Description: Given a 9-element list, reshapes it into a 3x3 matrix and calculates:
     - Mean
     - Variance
     - Standard Deviation
     - Max
     - Min
     - Sum

### 2. **Demographic Data Analyzer** 
   This project analyzes demographic data from the UCI Adult dataset.  
   It answers questions like:  
   - Percentage of people with advanced education earning >50K  
   - Most popular occupations in India  
   - Average working hours for high earners, etc.  


### 3. **Medical Data Visualizer** 
This project is part of [freeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/medical-data-visualizer).  
It analyzes and visualizes medical data using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

#### üìå Project Description
   We are working with patient data (`medical_examination.csv`) that contains information about body measurements, blood tests, lifestyle           choices, and cardio disease presence.  
   
   The project requires creating two visualizations:
   1. **Categorical Plot (catplot.png)**  
      - Shows the distribution of various categorical features (smoke, alco, active, cholesterol, gluc, overweight) split by cardiovascular              disease.
   2. **Heatmap (heatmap.png)**  
      - Shows correlations between numerical features in the dataset after cleaning the data.

### 4. **Page View Time Series Visualizer** (coming soon)
### 5. **Sea Level Predictor** (coming soon)
